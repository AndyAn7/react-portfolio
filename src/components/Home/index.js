                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                    
                    <p>I've recently begun the process of immersing myself in computer science with an aim to take part in the advance of humanity via technology and the data derived within. In time, I intend on entering into the field of technology upon the foundation of Full-Stack development; thenceforth, I plan to study and perform my way into the field of data science to take part in the apex of technology as is current, Artificial Intelligence.</p>

                    <p>Here, at this juncture of my path into computer science, I present basic assignments and projects I've completed, or taken part in completing, during my time as a student at the University of Washington's Full-Stack Boot Camp program.</p>
                        
                    <p>Though these are all works of progress towards my ultimate goal within Tech, I hope that you find yourself within good-impression as you peruse through my portfolio.</p>
                        
                   <p>Thanks!</p>
